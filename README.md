### Introduction:
In a natural ventilation system, it is necessary to regulate the conditioning of air, humidity, temperature and light through adjusting window and louver/blind angle. An automatic system that can adapt to current conditions is the key to comfort and energy savings.

### Our Solution:
Louver/blind and window that can adjust its opening angle based on rain/thunderstorm sounds combined with environmental conditions (light intensity, humidity, temperature) by using 2 ML models (one for sound classification and the other one for fusion of environmental conditions) in separate MCUs.
